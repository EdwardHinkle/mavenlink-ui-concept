# Mavenlink UI Concept

Concept of a Mavenlink UI component library and design guide.

## Intent

This project intends to accomplish two things:

1. Provide a library of styles and components that can be used directly by Mavenlink and others to implement user interfaces.

2. Provide an aesthetically pleasing and searchable site containing documentation and examples for each of the styles or components, as well as design principles.

More importantly, these two things exist to increase UI consistency and speed of development, and to facilitate collaboration amongst a much wider group of people.
